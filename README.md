Agridon encompasses three key aspects of agricultural science: Soil Type Prediction, Plant Disease Prediction, and Crop and Fertilizer Prediction. Through this project, farmers can find answers to important questions such as determining plant health, analysing suitable crops to grow, finding out appropriate fertilizers to use, and identifying their soil type. Soil Type Prediction and Plant Disease Prediction employ Convolutional Neural Networks trained on a collection of images, while Crop and Fertilizer Prediction utilizes a CSV dataset and a Support Vector Machine model.
The current requirement is to adopt environmentally friendly practices and promote sustainable agriculture in order to contribute to a greener future. The goal of sustainable agricultural practices is to safeguard the environment, enhance the Earth's natural resources, and preserve soil fertility.
Furthermore, this project offers the potential to enhance economic stability and increase crop yields. With the ever-increasing demands of the global population, maximizing the production of high-quality crops is a crucial objective in the field of agriculture.


Here is the User Interface for each segment of Agridon:
